## Instructions
Create a character concept for a Star Wars MUD. This is a roleplaying environment that is text-based, like writing a novel with many other players over a long period of time. Consider the lore of the universe, as well as the character-specific information and context provided below.

You will create:
- A character backstory and motivation, considering the character's family relations, current lore, and likely behaviors. This will be kept private and used for informing other contexts. Include tone, visual style (clothing/aesthetic, hairstyle, etc.), ideological, and political contexts.
- A Character Sheet, based on the template below, leveraging this backstory and motivation. This will be accessible to staff and assist with future applications & driving character ideology.
- A bio file, based on the bio template below. This will be accessible to other players and should have the tone of a short narrative biography and generally information that would be known or determinable by the public (government, school, news).
- A series of 30 "think logs", literal thematic "thoughts" to be entered into a think log viewable by game staff. These should be in the character's past, around 2 sentences long. You can think of these like diary entries to help flesh out the growth of the character from youth to adulthood. They can describe experiences with parents, siblings, jobs, major life events, and the like. The tone & theme as well as topics can evolve as the character ages. Each one should include a number of years ago, and the character's age at the time.
- A description, based on the sample description below. It is important that you follow the description rules & examples below.

## Character Specific Context




## Description rules and examples
### Description Rules
Your description should be a paragraph or two describing what your character looks like. It should describe what your character looks like and not how others around them feel. It should also not include what actions others take. Examples of this include are 'You feel a sense of awe' or 'Your eyes avert and you know this isnt someone you would want to mess with'. Do not include descriptions of clothes, weapons, tools, or other objects, with the exception of special accessories or parts of the body; for example, you may note that a tattoo 'pokes out from behind' a sleeve, or describe a particular special necklace. The game has a built-in system for clothing that is separate from this description process, so we should not assume the character is wearing specific clothing unless there is a particular reason.

### Description Formatting
You will note that the description only continues for so many characters before starting a new line; this is because in the MUD, there is a buffer column wrap that begins at column 88. Therefore, most players ensure that the number of characters on one line (not counting color codes) does not exceed 88 columns in the input editor, and create a new line if it would do so. You can have as many color codes as you like, though, and the game will not count them against this 88 column limit.

You can weave the color throughout the description. Since descriptions have an 88-column limit not counting color tags, you can use this to determine where the colors will show up in the buffer on output and use this to be creative, possibly using multiple colors per line or even per word, or creating a pattern that is overarching throughout the description. It is also common practice to highlight specific colors that are on the user, such as their hair color or eye color, including gradients or variable similar colors within the same strings to create an interesting effect.

### Generic Description Examples
This young male Twi'lek is surprisingly easy on the eyes. His skin, an
exceedingly rare Rutian turquoise, is stretched taut over rippling muscles and
a willowy frame. A number of black tribal tattoos mingle and play along the
contours of his muscled body, lending even more to his exotic look. He carries
himself with the gentle grace and sensual swagger of an extremely well-trained
dancer.

His handsome face is alight with playful curiosity. His lekku, a full half his
height in length, curve back from his brow and flow down his torso to come to a
tapered end near his waist. The angry, bloodshot eyes so common to males of his
race are gone, replaced by a pair of lustrous violet orbs, and they radiate
with an inviting warmth. A slender nose marks the center of his flawless
features and comes to a gentle curve above the thin line of his soft lips. A
playful smile breaks the pleasant uniformity of his visage and reveals a
mouthful of sparkling white teeth.
-----------------------------------------------

Standing before you is a lithe Twi'lek female, standing about 1.7 meters tall.
Her skin is a light blue, a mix between the color of the sky and cerulean. Her
eyes are deep ebony orbs, with some flecks of gold around her pupils. A finely
made leather corset tightly can usually be found hugging her body, revealing a
rather tantalizing amount of flesh. Small scars can be seen on her lekku, and
running along her upper arms and back. She typically sports a smile or grin to
her purple tinted lips, humming some tune or another to herself. She carries
herself gracefully with a bit of a joyful skip to her step. There is a small
clink of metal as she moves, as the tools in her utility belt jostle around.
-----------------------------------------------

This human male is not quite six feet tall, with dirty blonde hair and bright
green eyes. There are a few scars on his face and neck, though none look very
recent. His face is clean-shaven, and his general appearance is clean if not
well-groomed. His nose appears to have been broken at least once, sitting just
slightly out of line with the rest of his face. His right hand appears to have
been cut recently, covered in a series of red lines that have scabbed over for
now. His clothes appear to be clean and well-made, though he seems to wear them
more for comfort than for work.

## Character Sheet template
<< SAMPLE CHARACTER SHEET >>
 
Character Name: Jesse James
 
Character Motives: Jesse strives to gain income, but he can't be tied down to a
job, or sedentary lifestyle. It's for this reason that he's decided that the
best way to make money, and still be adventurous and mobile is to rob stage
coaches, and hold up banks. Jesse does have an ulterior goal that other players
will not be privy to knowing, and that is that he is very much in love with a
woman, Calamity Jane, and part of his bravado is to impress Calamity Jane and
and hopefully win her love.
 
Character Strengths: Jesse projects himself to be very loyal to his gang, and
for the most part, he is very loyal. He can be persuaded to betray them, and
these circumstances are detailed below. Jesse is otherwise, loyal, trustworthy
to his gang, and willing to sacrifice profit in order to help a gang-member. As
far as criminals go, Jesse is very loyal and committed to his lifestyle.
 
Character Downfalls: Jesse's love for Calamity Jane can easily be used against
him in order to extract information from him, or even to betray his gang.
Should anyone threaten to harm Calamity Jane, Jesse is sure to do whatever it
takes to rescue her. Jesse also has an unusual affinity for strawberry ice
cream. If he is captured, the sheriff could offer him strawberry ice cream as a
means to extract at least a little information, but he won't give up too much
just for some ice cream.
 
Character Quirks and Other Miscellaneous Information: It's important to note
that Jesse can't resist being `called out` by anyone. If a player challenges
him to a duel, Jesse will accept every time. He doesn't like to appear weak, or
`yellow` and will therefore defend his honor. Also, Jesse finds anyone who
drinks anything other than whiskey or bourbon to be untrustworthy. `A man
drinks a man's drink!` is what he always says. Jesse will not enter a deal, or
trust anyone who can't hold their liquor.

## Color System & Formatting instructions

You should use the below color codes. These are accepted by the MUD in character descriptions, as well as bio, but not in other locations you will be generating. Always output text intended to be entered into the MUD without vertical spaces in between lines, and paragraphs will have a one line space with no newline character between them.

The color code is input like `&008This`. The maximum is one color per character. If a color code is used once, it will continue until it is terminated, which it should always be. For example, a string may look like: `&005This is a string that uses purple, and stops by returning to &008grey by using the grey code as an escape.` Grey is the default color for most things, unless another color has been selected. The default background of most terminals is black, so avoid using colors that are possible but difficult to see on a black background. Reference any color instructions the user has put in the Character Info section of this prompt to guide your use of colors. **Never use black.**

## Game lore

### Era Intro

STAR WARS: LEGENDS OF THE JEDI                           
ERA 1: Ghosts of the Past  
    
The galaxy is on edge. 225 years after the end of the Great Galactic War, the  
GALACTIC REPUBLIC and SITH EMPIRE are beginning to move beyond the scars of  
conflict. The two major powers remain divided by two key barriers: a vast  
stretch of independent systems known as the Neutral Zone, and a hazardous  
region called SHATTERED SPACE \- the aftermath of the infamous Battle of  
Shattered Stars. This perilous zone, filled with gravitational distortions and  
debris, remains impassable. Yet after decades of uneasy peace and the war a  
distant memory, both governments are entering a period of renewal, casting  
their gaze toward the neutral territories that have long kept them apart.  
    
The JEDI ORDER, vigilant protectors of the Galactic Republic, stand ready to  
defend peace and justice, while the enigmatic SITH, ruling their Empire with an  
iron grip, consolidate their power. Throughout the galaxy, numerous factions  
vie for influence, from powerful engineering conglomerates to criminal  
syndicates eager to seize control. As the galaxy inches closer to renewed  
conflict, whispers of unseen threats emerge, rekindling old rivalries and  
stoking the fires of tension.  
     
With allegiances shifting and past wounds reopening, neutral worlds face  
mounting pressure to choose sides or fortify their own strength. Can the  
Republic and Empire find a path to coexistence, or does this new age of  
expansion herald a looming war that will once again engulf the galaxy? What  
role will YOU play in shaping the galaxys destiny? The legend awaits\!

### Meet The Clans

#### The Galactic Republic  
The Republic is a vast and diverse interstellar government, originally founded on principles of democracy, liberty, and mutual cooperation among its member worlds. Governed by a central Senate, where representatives from each planet or sector convene, the Republic strives to maintain stability and peace across the galaxy. Though its core values emphasize diplomacy and peaceful resolution of conflicts, the Republic also possesses a powerful military to protect its citizens from external threats, particularly the Sith Empire. As it expands its influence, the Republic seeks to unite more worlds under its banner, believing that a strong, centralized government is the key to preserving freedom and ensuring the galaxy's long-term stability.

#### The Sith Empire    
The purpose of the strong is to rule the weak, and the purpose of the weak is to serve the strong. The Sith Empire once ruled vast stretches of the galaxy, but in the aftermath of the Great Galactic War and the crises of the Dark Succession, it has dwindled to a small pocket surrounding the throne world of Dromund Kaas. Even Korriban, the traditional cultural heart of the Sith, was lost. The true strength of the Sith Order was not destroyed, however, and under the leadership of Lord Emperor Darth Khatai the Sith have begun to rebuild their strength and extend their influence once more into their former territories. The day will come for the strong to take their rightful place once more.

#### 225 Years Ago: The Catastrophe of the Battle of Shattered Stars

It has been 225 years since the fateful Battle of Shattered Stars, a conflict that altered the course of galactic history. Modern historians view this battle as not just a turning point in the Great Galactic War, but a calamity whose scars remain with us today. The collapse of several stars during the battle \- the result of unchecked experimental weaponry \- created the treacherous expanse we now call Shattered Space. This region is a graveyard of ships and  
debris, an eternal reminder of the arrogance and desperation of two warring superpowers. The Republic and Sith sought to end the war with a decisive blow, but instead, they shattered the stars themselves, forever altering the galaxy's balance.  
   
The true nature of the battle remains shrouded in mystery, as few survived the cataclysmic event \- none more notable than the death of Sith Lord Darth Demonis, whose ambition had sparked the war itself. Some believe the weapon that caused the stars' destruction was a last-ditch effort by Demonis to claim victory, while contrarian opinions believe the Jedi Order tapped into a taboo magick known only to them with dangerous consequences.

#### 180 Years Ago: The Dark Succession and The Rise of Darth Khatai

Following the death of Darth Demonis, the Sith Empire descended into a series of brief but energetic power struggles as various Warlords and Dark Council members vyed for control. These internal power struggles, known as the Dark Succession, lasted decades, continually destabilizing the Empire even as the Galactic Republic slowly began to regain its footing. The power struggles reached a crescendo 180 years ago, when Darth Khatai \- a lesser-known Sith from the Empires fringes \- emerged victorious by systematically eliminating rivals and consolidating his rule. The move was cold, calculating, and trademark Sith. Remarkably, Darth Khatai has maintained his grip on power ever since. Historians attribute his unprecedented reign to a combination of ruthless tactics and dark mastery of the Force. His enduring rule has brought a degree of stability to the Sith Empire through fear and domination. Darth Khatai's legacy is one of cold ambition, defying the typical cycle of Sith leadership.

#### 153 Years Ago: Historic Treaty Conference Reaffirms Galactic Borders

Around 150 years ago, key representatives from the Sith Empire, Galactic Republic, and various Neutral Systems gathered for a historic conference to reaffirm the treaty that had ended the Great Galactic War. The negotiations, held on Ithor, sought to maintain the fragile peace that had persisted for nearly a century, establishing firm borders between the two superpowers and ensuring the continued independence of the Neutral Zone.  
   
This conference was a critical moment in post-war diplomacy, as it confirmed the political status quo and underscored the need for cooperation despite lingering tensions. Many historians view this agreement as one of the last major efforts to prevent the rekindling of hostilities, cementing the framework that has largely endured to this day.

#### 136 Years Ago: Mon Cala Civil War Divides Republic Loyalists

136 years ago, the Republic planet of Mon Cala was torn apart by civil war.

While still loyal to the Republic, they sought a more aggressive approach to the Sith threat. Their stance put them at odds with the traditionally peaceful Mon Calamari, leading to a bloody internal conflict. The Republic intervened, but the scars of the war continue to impact Mon Cala's politics to this day.

#### 122 Years Ago: Famed Expedition Into Shattered Space Vanishes Without a Trace

The disease's rapid spread and severe symptoms caused a global health crisis, prompting urgent humanitarian aid from various sectors of the galaxy. Despite extensive research and quarantine measures, the origins and full nature of the plague remain largely unknown, with many speculating about possible biological or even engineered causes.

#### 78 Years Ago: Emergence of the Darth Demonis Cult

Around 78 years ago, a mysterious and radical Sith collective known only as the Darth Demonis Cult began to gain prominence within the galaxy. Named after the infamous Sith Lord Darth  emonis, whose death had previously destabilized the Sith Empire, this cult embraced his dark legacy and sought to resurrect his influence. While they have never been more than a minor factor in the culture of the Sith Empire, the cult nevertheless persists to this day.

#### 10 Years Ago: The Discovery of Planet Bespin

Only 10 years ago, the gas giant Bespin was officially charted by the Galactic Historical Society's exploration efforts.

#### 9 Years Ago: Annual Survey of Shattered Space Boundaries

Galactic Historical Society Annual Report  
Prepared by: Galactic Survey Division  
File Reference: SS-Probe-65-R-VI  
    
Subject: Boundary Conditions and Anomalous Readings in Shattered Space The Galactic Survey Division has completed its 65th annual assessment of the outer boundaries of Shattered Space. As in previous years, the region continues to demonstrate remarkable stability and consistency.  
   
Key Findings:  
\*Gravitational fluctuations are consistent with prior years, maintaining their highly disruptive patterns that make any passage through Shattered Space unfeasible.   
\*The debris field surrounding the collapsed star systems remains dense, with no significant movement detected. No new objects or previously unseen anomalies have been recorded.  
\*Theta-band radiation levels remain stable, with no detectable fluctuations from year-to-year, reinforcing the theory that the region is in a state of equilibrium.  
    
Conclusions:  
The boundaries of Shattered Space remain impassable, unchanged since the Battle of Shattered Stars ended 225 years ago. The region's persistent hazardous conditions continue to defy efforts at exploration or passage. It is the opinion of this committee that future surveys are unlikely to produce novel results unless there is a fundamental shift in either our understanding of gravitational anomalies or an unanticipated event that alters the structure of the space.  
   
Recommendations:  
\*Continue annual monitoring of Shattered Space as per standing Galactic protocols.  
\*No additional resources are recommended for exploration at this time.  
End of Report.
